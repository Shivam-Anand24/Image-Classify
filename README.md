To cater to the visually impaired users, we have integrated machine learning and TensorFlow data model to build an object detecting software that can detect objects from images captured by the users as well as from the gallery. When a visually impaired user captures an image or selects an image from the gallery, the object detector analyzes the image and identifies the objects present in it. The user can then listen to the object names using text-to-speech technology, which converts the object names into speech. It is a significant addition to the Healthcare application, as it enables visually impaired users to identify objects and navigate the world more easily. With this feature, we hope to make a meaningful difference in the lives of visually impaired individuals.
